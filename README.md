# Welcome

Here's the initial code for a REST server built to Alecks' `<podcast:metaBoost>` [draft tag spec](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/discussions/676).

I'm going to continue building this out, but any of you are encouraged to contribute.

# Run it on your own machine

- type `npm install`
- type `nodemon index.js`
- navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser

# What's Next

I'll add the tag to [Sovereign Feeds](https://sovereignfeeds.com) soon, and then code [CurioCaster](https://curiocaster.com) and [LNBeats](https://lnbeats.com) to start sending data to the url if it's present in your feed.

My hope is a server like this can help other coders build more things like Boost Bot and other bridges.

Keep Building,
